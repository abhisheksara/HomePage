Hello!

As a part of this project, I created a basic webpage with 4 html pages:
home.html
schedule.html
contact.html
more.html
and the stylesheet files style.scss and style.css.

The navigation bar on top of each page can be used to navigate to the other pages. I used flexbox feature of bootstrap for making this  navigation bar. The active
page is marked using #id which highlights the currently open webpage on the navigation bar. I also included hover effect for this bar.
I included a media query for this navigation bar which makes the navigation bar vetical on smaller screens by changing the flex direction.


The home.html file contains some information about me and includes a picture of myself.

The schedule.html page contains a table which shows the courses I have undertaken this semester.

The contact.html file contains two icons clicking on which would direct the visitors to my social media accounts. It also contains my mail address.

The more.html file contains a unordered list of my interests.

I have used the grid feature of bootstrap two get two columns for layout in more.html and home.html files

I have used sass to convert the scss script into css
In the style.scss file, i have made use of several feautres of sass and css like variables for color, nesting, .class selector, #id selector, and inheritance.
I have created a 'basicnav' class and inherited its features while defining a class for the navigation bar.
